like menu especially issues ive nook parts ive owned two cords past year alone makes multitaking easier switching one application another say reading internet dont go home menu function first us nook color originals takes adjusting old habits far bad changethe reader application functions much friendly manner page numbers bottom pages instead top much less chintzy font pulling menu tell many pages left chapter really necessary change kind nice fonts added along finally adding option change tone page white sepia night offwhite books also read sideways twopage fashion though ill admit dont use much wont even ability something kids books makes actual reader app much rounded friendly onethe magazine reader changes nice animations page turns though dont option books big incongruency though animations disappear zoom menu bottom pulls pages miniature picture form much appealing accessible manner rather macesque really nothing huge makes friendlylooking randomly magazine reading app one n button still home button menu one wondering theyll notice change futurethe pdf reader awesome changes reading pdf files incredibly clunky resolve well screen reading book involved zooming scrolling instead sideways like ereader application closed pdf file reopening would take right back page one never saved last place ridiculously cumbersome userfriendly new update saves place resolves page text fits better screen allows pages read much easily sideways also scrolls sideways instead makes sense follows overall expectations reading experienceinterestingly enough still havent resolved issue pdf files cover home screen menu even information attached something hoping theyd resolve huge issue visual annoyance epub files cool graphics show home screen pdf files grey title book lameoverall performance menu functions flipping tasks seems zippier really appreciate menu functions seem much efficient smooth makes much better interactionthe ebook store also changed around bn completely
